# What Next?

Congratulations! You've covered the template for learning a new programming language for Go! Below are some topics that I think would be important for covering to gain a better understanding of Go.

## Concurrency

Go comes with a built in powerful concurrency model. Learn about the following:

- **Goroutines**: Threads managed by the Go runtime.
- **Channels**: Ways to communicate between goroutines.

### Resources:

- Official Docs: [Go Concurrency](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go#concurrency)

## Error Handling

Learn how Go handles errors and how to do it too!

- Using `error` as a return value.
- Creating your own errors.
- Learn about `defer`, `panic`, and `recover` additions to procedural programming.

## Interfaces and Polymorphism

Learn about the object-oriented side of Go with interfaces. Interfaces bring abstraction and polymorphism software design principles to Go.

## Conclusion

Keep going with learning Go! You got this!
